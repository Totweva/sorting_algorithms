Sortinng Algorithms
In this project the following sorting algoriths are implemented in C

Bubble sort
Insertion sort
Selection sort
Quick sort
Bubble Sort


A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the input list element by element comparing the current element with the one after it and swapping them if needed. The list becomes fully sorted when there are no more swaps to be performed.
Insertion Sort


Insertion sort repeatedly consumes one input element and finds the location it belongs to in the sorted list and inserts it there. It does this till no input element remains.
Selection Sort


Selection sort divides the input list into two parts, sublist of items which is built up from left to right at the front (left) of the list and a sublist of the remaining unsorted items that occupy the rest of the list. The sorted sublist is initially empty and is repeatedly populated by the least item (if sorted in an ascending order) from the unsorted sublist.
Quick sort


Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively.
